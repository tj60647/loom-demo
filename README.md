# Loom

**Weaving Knowledge Through Shared Practice**

Loom is a tool for emergent sense-making and collaborative synthesis. It provides a space where reading, capturing, and connecting ideas form a living knowledge graph—built entirely by you and your community, without auto-generation.

## What is Loom?

Loom was born from the intersection of ethnographic research, theory, and practice. It is designed to help individuals and cross-disciplinary teams build shared understanding not by enforcing uniformity, but by negotiating differences.

The core workflow is simple:
1. **Read & Capture:** Read texts and distill passages into short "bytes" in your own words.
2. **Throw:** Pick two bytes and connect them.
3. **Name the Relation:** Define the "edge" between these ideas yourself, using your own phrasing or pulling a verb from one of the "tongues" (disciplinary thought styles).

Nothing is auto-generated. The tool only counts your own throws. The structure emerges organically from your coding: from open codes first, to axial reads across texts.

## Features

- **Bite-Sized Capture:** Synthesize complex readings into discrete, manageable nodes ("bytes").
- **Intentional Connections ("Throws"):** The power of Loom lies in the edges. You decide exactly how two concepts relate. 
- **Disciplinary "Tongues":** The verbs we reach for to name a relation (e.g., *constrains*, *refutes*, *betrays*) aren't neutral; each belongs to a specific way of seeing the world. Loom lets you apply different lenses (e.g., "Cause & system" vs. "Stance & value") to the same connections to see how meaning shifts.
- **The Woven Graph:** View your interconnected graph ("Read") and generate an "axial read"—a synthesized narrative spanning multiple texts that you can instantly copy as a draft.

## The Theory Behind the Tool

Loom is built on foundational ideas from design theory, sociology, and ethnographic coding (see the [concept deck](./docs/presentations/coupled_spaces_deck_v12.pdf) for a deeper dive):

- **[Object Worlds (Bucciarelli)](./docs/readings/Bucciarelli-Designing%20Engineers.pdf):** Each discipline inhabits its own world with its own instruments and language. A mechanical engineer might name a connection "is the bottleneck for," while a humanist might say it "betrays" the text. Loom makes these differing worldviews visible and actionable.
- **[Communities of Practice (Wenger)](./docs/readings/Wenger_communities-of-practice.pdf):** Shared vocabularies are learned by participating in a community, not just by being told. Loom enables a class or team to grow its own shared edge-vocabulary over time by doing the work together.
- **[Boundary Objects (Star)](./docs/readings/Star,%202010%20'This%20Is%20Not%20A%20Boundary%20Object'.pdf):** How do people from distinct fields coordinate around one shared object without agreeing on exactly what it means? Loom serves as a cross-tongue boundary object—flexible enough to be locally useful, but robust enough to hold a common identity across groups.

## Developer Guide

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with `create-next-app`.

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx` (or `src/app/page.tsx`). The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Environment

`.env.local` (not committed). Run `vercel env pull` to populate the hosted values.

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | yes | Neon Postgres connection string. |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `NEXTAUTH_URL` | yes | NextAuth session signing and callback base. |
| `GITHUB_ID`, `GITHUB_SECRET` | yes | GitHub OAuth app credentials. |
| `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` | local dev | Vercel Blob access. On Vercel this is resolved from the OIDC token + `BLOB_STORE_ID` instead. |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | no | Enables the reading-quality judge. Absent, readings are still scored deterministically. |
| `LOOM_JUDGE_MODEL` | no | Judge model override. Defaults to `anthropic/claude-opus-5`; `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5` is a cheaper fit for the task. |

### Database migrations

Schema lives in `src/db/schema.ts`; migrations are generated, committed, and applied — never pushed straight from the schema.

```bash
npx drizzle-kit generate --name=what_changed   # write the SQL + snapshot
npx drizzle-kit migrate                        # apply anything pending
```

Check what the database already has before applying, especially in a shared environment — `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations` is the record of truth, and the journal alone can disagree with it.

### The reading library

PDFs are uploaded once into a shared, course-agnostic library, then included in any number of courses. Per-course facts (week, visibility, core vs. supplemental) live on the `course_source` join, not on the reading — so the same PDF is never uploaded twice, and hiding it in one course leaves the others alone.

- **Readings tab** (`/admin/library`) — the whole library. Upload one or many PDFs at a time, edit shared metadata, and add a reading to a course. Badges show which courses currently include it.
- **Courses tab** (`/admin/courses`) — each course's full reading list, with the per-course placement, visibility, and removal controls.

Uploads are processed independently: one corrupt PDF in a batch fails on its own and is reported by filename, and the rest still land.

#### Extraction scoring

Many course PDFs are scans with no usable text layer, which looks identical to a clean PDF on a library card and fails only when a student tries to quote from it. Every reading is therefore scored 1–5 on four dimensions (`src/lib/readingScore.ts`):

| Dimension | Measures | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `coverage` | Share of pages with extractable text. | deterministic |
| `legibility` | Readable text vs. glyph soup from a missing ToUnicode map. | deterministic, refined by judge |
| `anchorability` | Enough text per page for highlight offsets to hold. | deterministic |
| `structure` | Whether extraction preserved reading order. | judge only |

The deterministic pass runs at upload from the pages already in memory — no extra queries, no network. The judge runs afterwards via `after()`, so a twenty-file upload doesn't wait on twenty round trips.

Two invariants worth preserving if you touch this:

- **An unscored dimension abstains.** No key, a judge error, or unparseable output leaves the dimension `null` and the row at `status: "heuristic"` — never a substituted default, which would make "we didn't check" indistinguishable from "we checked and it failed."
- **The dimensions are not compensatory.** `pass` requires *every* scored dimension to clear 3, not the mean. A PDF whose fonts carry no ToUnicode map scores 5 on coverage and anchorability while being pure mojibake; averaging would call it usable.

The score is advisory. A reading below the bar is flagged "Needs review", never auto-hidden — see red line #7 in the [spec](./docs/loom-spec-v1.md), and the open question there about running a model inside the tool at all.
